Develop an offline mobile application using Flutter and Material UI, demonstrating the lifecycle of loan management. The app should simulate the entire loan process, starting from application to approval, disbursement, repayment tracking, and eventually closure.

 

Application Features: (Simulated for offline use)

1.              User Management:

    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin, Loan Officer, and Customer roles.

    - Implement OAuth2/JWT for authentication and authorization.

    - Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

2.              Loan Application Process:

    - Intuitive loan application form.

    - Document upload feature for verification (ID proof, income statements, etc.).

    - Simulated credit scoring and eligibility checks.

    - Loan approval workflow with multi-level approvals.

    - Notification provision for application status updates.

3.              Loan Disbursement:

    - Simulated banking API integration for disbursement.

    - Include multiple disbursement methods (bank transfer, check).

    - Disbursement status tracking.

4.              Repayment Management:

    - Automated generation of repayment schedules based on loan terms.

    - Calculation for interest, principal, and penalties.

    - Simulated payment gateway integration for repayments.

    - Reminders for upcoming payments.

5.              Loan Monitoring & Reporting:

    - Dashboard for loan status, repayments, and delinquencies.

    - Customizable reports (outstanding loans, revenue generated, default rates).

    - Simulated integration with accounting systems (QuickBooks, Xero).

6.              Customer Communication:

    - Centralized communication log.

    - Templates for automated customer communication.

 

Deliverables:

1.              Offline mobile app with functional Flutter code and simulated API data.

2.              User navigation for all use cases.

3.              Unit and integration tests for primary functionalities.

4.              Scripts for deployment and CI/CD pipeline setup.

**Assistant:**

Certainly. I'll develop an offline mobile application using Flutter and Material UI for loan management as per your requirements. Let's break this down into steps and start working on the project.

<thinking>
To begin, we need to set up the project structure and create the main Flutter application files. We'll use the following steps:

1. Create a new Flutter project
2. Set up the basic file structure
3. Implement the main application file
4. Create a basic home screen

Let's start by creating the project structure.

All done!
You can find general documentation for Flutter at: https://docs.flutter.dev/
Detailed API documentation is available at: https://api.flutter.dev/
If you prefer video documentation, consider: https://www.youtube.com/c/flutterdev

In order to run your application, type:

  $ cd loan_management_app
  $ flutter run

Your application code is in loan_management_app\lib\main.dart.

**Assistant:**

Great, we've successfully created the Flutter project. Now, let's set up the basic file structure and implement the main application file.

<thinking>
We need to create the following directory structure:
- lib/
  - models/
  - screens/
  - services/
  - utils/
  - widgets/

Let's create these directories and then update the main.dart file with a basic structure for our loan management app.

Great! We've now set up the basic structure of our Loan Management App. Let's summarize what we've done so far:

1. Created a new Flutter project called "loan_management_app"
2. Set up the basic directory structure for our app
3. Updated the main.dart file with a basic app structure
4. Created a HomeScreen widget with placeholder buttons for main functionalities

Now, let's start implementing the core features of our app. We'll begin by creating models for our data structures.

**Assistant:**

Great! We've now created the basic models for our Loan Management App. Let's summarize what we've done so far:

1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Created the main app and home screen
3. Implemented data models for User, Loan, LoanApplication, and Payment

Now, let's start implementing some of the core features of our app. We'll begin by creating a loan application form.

<thinking>
We need to create a new screen for the loan application form. This form should include fields for:
1. Requested loan amount
2. Requested loan term
3. Purpose of the loan
4. User's personal information (if not already available)
5. Document upload functionality (simulated)

Let's create a new file called loan_application_screen.dart in the screens directory.

**Assistant:**

Thank you for providing the context. It seems that we were in the process of developing a Loan Management App using Flutter. Let's reassess the current state of the project and continue with the development.

<thinking>
Based on the files visible and opened tabs, we have:
1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Created the main app (main.dart) and home screen (home_screen.dart)
3. Implemented data models for User, Loan, LoanApplication, and Payment
4. Created a LoanApplicationScreen

The last step we completed was creating the loan_application_screen.dart file. Now, we need to:
1. Update the home_screen.dart to navigate to the LoanApplicationScreen
2. Implement more features such as loan status checking and repayment
3. Add authentication and user management
4. Implement offline data storage
5. Add unit tests for the main functionalities
</thinking>

Let's start by updating the home_screen.dart to navigate to the LoanApplicationScreen when the "Apply for Loan" button is pressed.

**Assistant:**

Great! We've now implemented the basic structure of our Loan Management App with the following features:
1. Loan Application
2. Loan Status Checking
3. Repayment

Let's summarize what we've accomplished and what still needs to be done:

Completed:
1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Created the main app (main.dart) and home screen (home_screen.dart)
3. Implemented data models for User, Loan, LoanApplication, and Payment
4. Created screens for Loan Application, Loan Status, and Repayment
5. Implemented navigation between screens

To Do:
1. Implement authentication and user management
2. Implement offline data storage
3. Add unit tests for the main functionalities
4. Improve the UI and add more detailed information to each screen
5. Implement actual loan processing logic (approval, disbursement, etc.)
6. Add error handling and input validation

Let's start by implementing a basic authentication system. We'll create a simple login screen and a user service to manage user data.

First, let's create a LoginScreen:
[Tool Use: write_to_file]
Path: loan_management_app\lib\screens\login_screen.dart

  @override
  _LoginScreenState createState() => _LoginScreenState();
}

class _LoginScreenState extends State<LoginScreen> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  final _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final _passwordController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(

      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Form(

              const SizedBox(height: 24),
              ElevatedButton(

              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _login() {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
      // TODO: Implement actual authentication logic
      final email = _emailController.text;
      final password = _passwordController.text;

      if (UserService.authenticate(email, password)) {

    }
  }

Excellent! We've now implemented a basic authentication system for our Loan Management App. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created a LoginScreen with email and password fields
2. Implemented a basic UserService for authentication
3. Updated the main.dart file to start with the LoginScreen
4. Added a logout functionality to the HomeScreen

The app now has the following features:
1. User authentication (login and logout)
2. Loan Application
3. Loan Status Checking
4. Repayment

Next steps to complete the app:
1. Implement offline data storage using a local database (e.g., SQLite or Hive)
2. Add unit tests for the main functionalities
3. Improve the UI and add more detailed information to each screen
4. Implement actual loan processing logic (approval, disbursement, etc.)
5. Add error handling and input validation
6. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user types

Let's implement offline data storage using the Hive package, as it's easy to use and provides good performance for Flutter apps.

First, we need to add the Hive package to our pubspec.yaml file. Let's update it:

**Assistant:**

Great! Now that we've added the Hive packages, we need to update our models to work with Hive. Let's start by updating the User model:
[Tool Use: write_to_file]
Path: loan_management_app\lib\models\user.dart
Content: import 'package:hive/hive.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@HiveType(typeId: 0)
class User extends HiveObject {
  @HiveField(0)
  late String id;

  @HiveField(1)
  late String name;

  @HiveField(2)
  late String email;

  @HiveField(3)
  late String role;

  User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    required this.role,
  });

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json['id'],
      name: json['name'],
      email: json['email'],
      role: json['role'],
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'email': email,
      'role': role,
    };
  }
}
